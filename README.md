## âœ… Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**            | An LLM-based reasoning unit that can interact with users and tools.         |
| **Tool**             | A callable function or external API integrated into the agent workflow.     |
| **Architecture**     | Layered: Agent â†” Tool â†” Orchestration                                        |
| **Execution**        | Synchronous or Asynchronous for scalability.                                 |
| **Multi-modal**      | Supports image, text, and structured inputs/outputs.                         |
| **Framework Comparison** | Autogen is more tool-integrated than LangChain and more modular than LangGraph. |

> ðŸ“Œ Tip: Use Autogen to build AI agents that can **reason, call functions, and interact across multiple tools or APIs** with minimal boilerplate.
