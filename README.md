# 🚀 Getting Started with Autogen

This tutorial walks you through the basics of setting up and using **Autogen** for building simple agent workflows using function tools and large language models (LLMs).

# 🔄 Autogen vs. LangGraph

This guide compares **Autogen** and **LangGraph**, two powerful frameworks for building LLM-powered workflows. While Autogen excels at agent-based communication and tool integration, LangGraph offers fine-grained control using a graph-based structure.

## 🧠 Feature Comparison

| Feature                | **Autogen**                                                                 | **LangGraph**                                                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core Focus**         | Agent-based workflows (multi-agent, tool-using LLMs)                        | State machine-based workflows (graph of nodes)                            |
| **Abstraction**        | High-level abstraction over agent behaviors and tool interactions           | Graph-based abstraction with control over node execution                  |
| **Execution Model**    | Supports synchronous and asynchronous execution                             | Asynchronous by default                                                   |
| **Tool Usage**         | Native support for tools (FunctionTool, OpenAI functions, custom APIs)      | Tools are defined within custom nodes                                     |
| **Orchestration**      | Multi-agent message passing with chat-style flow                            | Directed graph execution with conditional branching                       |
| **Multi-agent Support**| ✅ Built-in and powerful                                                     | ⚠️ Possible, but requires manual orchestration                            |
| **Use Cases**          | Conversational agents, assistants, automated pipelines                      | Retrieval pipelines, DAG workflows, multi-step logic                      |
| **Ease of Use**        | Beginner-friendly for agentic workflows                                     | Requires familiarity with graph-based execution                           |
| **Visualization**      | Partial Mermaid support                                                     | Native graph view with Mermaid diagrams                                   |

## 🧠 Key Concepts Summary

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**           | An LLM-based reasoning unit that can interact with users and tools.         |
| **Tool**            | A callable function or external API integrated into the agent workflow.     |
| **Architecture**    | Layered: Agent ↔ Tool ↔ Orchestration                                        |
| **Execution**       | Supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes.                           |
| **Multi-modal**     | Handles image, text, and structured outputs like JSON.                      |
| **Framework Comparison** | Autogen is more tool-integrated than LangChain and more modular than LangGraph. |

> 📌 **Tip:** Use **Autogen** when your goal is agentic reasoning, tool use, and human-like conversations.  
> Use **LangGraph** when you need deterministic, graph-based control over LLM workflows like RAG pipelines or complex branching logic.
